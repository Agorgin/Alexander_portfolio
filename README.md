# Alexander's Data Science Portfolio
This is my data science portfolio! Here, I will be giving an overview of and showcase the academic projects I have done.

# [Project 1: Air France](https://github.com/Agorgin/Air-france-business-case)

This is my first project on the Air France business case using R!


My team and I analyzed Air France's international marketing campaigns and have generated recommendations for effective search engine marketing.

The dataset is sources from the case study on Air France International Marketing by Kellog School of Business. The external libraries used are readxl, dplyr, plotly, ggplot2, tidyverse.

The project employs visual and statistical tools in R and applies a strategy for missing values. Additionally, my team added important metrics for subsequent analysis, i.e. return on advertisement and net income.

Then, my team used descriptive analysis to identify the most effect marketing channel and generate a publiser strategy. We identified the effectiveness of campaigns, the best keyword match type and advertisement bid strategies by publisher.

Lastly, we shared our findings a 6 minute presentation in form of a video presentation.
